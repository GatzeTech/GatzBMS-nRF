# GatzBMS-nRF

Short explanation for now.

I was a bit annoyed with the Chinese BMS's that you don't have any feedback on the status of for example balancing or why it cutt off power. Once I was in the middle of nowhere when my eBike suddenly stopped and physically I'm really dependant on the electric system so for example in such case, I want to read out the voltage's and decide for myself if it is still safe to go on. If I have to bike myself physically longer distance's (5 km) I can be sick for day's. In that case one cell group was a little bit off, but still in the safe range, in that case I want to be able to put the mosfets on again for example via bluetooth.

So I came up with the idea to design myself a BMS. The goal is to use simple components (also with the chip delivery problems in mind) except for the microcontroller/Soc. It's a compromise between functionality, costs, availability, simplicity.
